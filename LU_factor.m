function [L,A]=LU_factor(A,n)
% LU factorization of an n by n matrix A
% using Gauss elimination without pivoting
% LU_factor.m
% A is factored as A = L*U
% Output:
% L is lower triangular with the main diagonal part = 1s.
% U is upper triangular and is stored in the original mtx A
% and must be zeroed out to get U
